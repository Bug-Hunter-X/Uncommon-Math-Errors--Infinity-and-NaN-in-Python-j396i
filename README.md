This repository demonstrates a Python function that can encounter uncommon mathematical errors involving infinity (inf) and NaN (Not a Number).  The function includes basic error handling, but the focus is on highlighting the behavior of inf and NaN in calculations.  The solution file provides additional error handling and input validation to manage these cases more gracefully.
